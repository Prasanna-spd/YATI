Why people hate girl child? The irony is even elderly women hate girl child. They do not realize one thing, that they too were born as a girl child and became women as they get aged. But totally forget everything and straightaway hate girl children.</span></p>

        <h1 class="blog-title">Domestic Violence</h1>
        <p class="blog-overview">Domestic violence (also domestic <span id="g">...</span><span id="s">abuse, spousal abuse, family violence) is a pattern of violent or abusive behavior by one person against another in a domestic context, such as in a marriage or during cohabitation. Allow me to share some stats on domestic violence from National Coalition Against Domestic Violence:

Every minute, nearly 20 people are victims of physical violence by a partner in the United States. This equates to more than 10 million women and men a year.
85% of domestic violence victims are women.
Historically, females are most often victimized by someone they knew.
Nearly 7.8 million women have been raped by an intimate partner at some point in their lives. And this is a figure from 2003. An estimated 201,394 women are raped by an intimate partner each year.
On a typical day, more than 20,000 phone calls are made to domestic violence hotlines in U.S.
Sexual assault or forced sex occurs in approximately 40-45% of battering relationships.
Intimate partner violence (i.e. abuse by a significant other) accounts for 15% of all violent crimes.
Almost one-third of female homicide victims are killed by an intimate partner.
One in every four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime.
Last but not least… most cases of domestic violence are never reported to the police.</span></p>
