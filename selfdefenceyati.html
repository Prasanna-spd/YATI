        <h1 class="blog-title">Are you been Stalked ? </h1>
        <p class="blog-overview"> Stalking consists of repeated and unwanted <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">attention that can make you feel afraid, unsafe, and stressed out. For this reason, it can sometimes be hard to know what to do in order to feel safer and cope with the negative impact of stalking.

            1. But if you are proactive and implement some safety strategies and ask for help from friends and family members as well as local law enforcement, it should help ease your concerns some. That said, while it's important to implement as many safety precautions as possible, you will never completely eliminate the risks associated with being stalked
            General Safety Strategies
            <br>
           2. When it comes to stalking, there are some things you can do to make your life a little safer. In addition to going out in groups, keeping your home locked, and being aware of your surroundings, here are some other safety strategies to help you deal with the stalking you're experiencing.
           <br>
            
           3. Find a safe place to go if someone is following you. For instance, go to the nearest police station or fire station, a friend's house, a public place, or a shelter. Know where these locations are in your community and how to get there.
           <br>
           4. Carry your cell phone with you at all times and keep it charged.
            You want to be able to call for help if you need to.
           <br>
            5. Trust your instincts. If you feel like something is wrong or unsafe, trust your gut. Consider leaving the uncomfortable situation, even if nothing is happening at the moment. Usually, your instincts or gut reaction is your first warning that you're in danger.
            <br>
            6.  Vary your routes and your routines. If you always take the same route to work or walk your dog at the same time every day, these patterns make it easier for a stalker to find you and monitor your activities. Try to take different routes and vary your routine. You may even want to change where you shop and get coffee so that it's harder for the person stalking you to predict where you will be at any given time.
            <br>
           7. Exercise with a buddy. If you enjoy running, hiking, biking, or walking, you should consider getting a buddy to work out with. Exercising alone or in secluded areas like bike trails or in parks can put you at risk when it comes to stalking.
           <br>
            8. Try not to go too many places alone. Although it may be difficult to have someone with you at all times, the less time you are alone when you're out, the better. For example, ask your friends or family members to accompany you if you need to walk to your car after dark or invite a friend to go shopping with you.
            <br>
           9. Be cautious of what you post online. Even if you have blocked the person stalking you online, there are ways for them to see what you're up to. So, be sure you are not sharing too many details about your life. You also should avoid checking in to different locations online. Doing so, allows the person stalking you to know where you are at the moment.
           <br>
           10. Consider taking a self-defense class. Although the best defense is to put distance between you and the person stalking you, you want to be sure you know how to defend yourself in case they catch you by surprise or there is no way out. Taking a self-defense class also can help you feel more empowered and self-confident.
           <br>
           11. Create a safety plan. Even though you are likely not living with the person stalking you, a safety plan can help you prepare for different scenarios and strategize on how to stay safe. Plus, going through the steps can help you feel empowered and like you are taking control of your situation.
           <br>
           12. Refrain from responding to emails and messages. In general, it's best not to respond to someone who is stalking you. Don't answer their emails, texts, phone calls, messages, or even just to tell them to stop. Any type of response, even an angry one, could be encouraging to the person stalking you.
           <br>
           13. Seek counseling. If you are currently being stalked, it's important that you take care of your mental health. Stalking is a traumatic experience and many of those targeted experience depressive disorders or PTSD.6 A trained mental health professional can help you navigate this situation and help you take care of yourself mentally and emotionally.

        <h1 class="blog-title"> Sexual harassment at the workplace </h1>
        <p class="blog-overview">Sexual harassment can take place in many forms<span id="dot">...</span><span id="p">At the very first, every woman must know certain things about sexual harassment:
            <br>

             1. One should never ever ignore sexual harassment in the hope that it will go away as the time passes. It won’t. You must know that sexual harassment is a violence against you and this must be stop by you.
             <br>
            
            2. One must clearly say ‘NO’. One must make it very clear about what you don’t want and that the behavior is totally unwelcome and you also have to make the person realize that the behavior is harassing you and is offensive. It can be possible that the harasser never realized his behavior was offensive one.
            <br>
            
            3. The victim should endeavour to keep evidence of acts done by the harasser to harass the victim. If the harassment is violent, verbally or physically, the victim must seek help from the company, the police or any other non- governmental body working on women’s issues. If the harassment includes physical assault, she must get a medical examination done and keep the reports safe. Evidence is a must to pursue a legal case. And if the harassment is less- violent, one must document the incident precisely and record every event, along with the place and time of the same. One must remember to make such documentation or notes in their personal computer or notepad and not in the office computer.
            <br>
            
            4. And then, one can opt some of the informal ways to stop the harassment against you. Such as:
            <br>
            
            4.1.    By sending a copy of the institution sexual harassment policy (if anti- sexual harassment policy is already formulated at your workplace) to the person who is making you uncomfortable, with appropriate sections underlined.
            <br>
            
            4.2.    By writing a letter to the perpetrator about all his offensive behavior, incidents, saying that you want this behavior to stop immediately. This letter should be sent by the registered post and a copy of the same must be kept for future reference. It can also be used as evidence of any official complaint or legal proceedings.
            <br>
            
            5. If the above informal ways do not stop the harassment, filing a formal complaint will be the next step.
            <br>
            
             6. At first, the victim of the sexual harassment needs to find out, if her workplace already has a complaints committee to deal with sexual harassment. And if it already exists, she must find out the name of the appropriate person who deals with these complaints and report the behavior of the harasser to the appropriate person. And in case, the workplace do not have any policy to deal with the complaints regarding sexual harassment, a demand to formulate such policy in the workplace must be made, so that the future victims of sexual harassment in the workplace have the mechanism to address their situation. The victim may also demand employer’s help in filing a legal case. It may happen that the employer or the concerned higher authorities of the company do not solve the problem, in that case, the victim should not rely exclusively on them. If the victim is a member of the labour union, then she must discuss the problem with the union representatives. Or lastly, one may seek help from any non- governmental organization, who deals with the issues related to sexual harassment of women in the workplace and pursue legal action against the harasser. </span></p>

        <h1 class="blog-title">Actions against CHILD marriage</h1>
        <p class="blog-overview">Ending child marriage is no small task<span id="g">...</span><span id="s">but many small actions can create big change. We don’t have to stand by and accept practices that hurt children and communities - instead, here are three actions we can all take:
            <br>
            1. Report any child marriage happening around you to the proper authorities
            <br>
           2. Educate your friends, family and community about why child marriage is harmful
            <br>
           3. Promise to never be a part of any event that promotes child marriage
           <br>
           4.  Child marriage is illegal in India. Every child has a right to go to school and not face violence but getting married early often denies them these rights.
           <br>
           5. Every child marriage hurts our entire family and community. When a girl or boy gets married before they turn 18, they are less likely to finish school. This can limit their chances at getting a skilled job, lower their lifetime income and create a worse life for their children in the future.
           <br>
           6. We all want girls and babies in this community to be healthy and safe. When a girl gets married as a child, she’s more likely to give birth too early. When young girls have babies, they’re more likely to be in danger during childbirth and so are their babies.
           <br>
           7. Every year, fewer and fewer children in India are getting married. More parents and community leaders are seeing the negative impacts of child marriage and are aware of the law. Our community can do the same </span>

        <p class="blog-overview">Ending child marriage is no small task <span id="do">...</span><span id="q"> but many small actions can create big change. We don’t have to stand by and accept practices that hurt children and communities - instead, here are three actions we can all take:
            <br>
            (a) Cancellation / permanent termination of the doctor’s license who participates in fulfilling a client’s demand to do away with her girl child. 
            <br>
            (b) Heavy penalty imposed on companies like GE that specialize in marketing medical equipment used for illegal sex determination and abortion in unlicensed clinics and hospitals.
            <br>
            (c) High fines and judicial action against „parents‟, who knowingly try to kill their unborn baby. 
            <br>
            (d) Widespread campaigns and seminars for young adults and potential parents to enlighten them about the ill effects of female feticide. Ignorance is one of the major causes for the increase in the selective sex abortion cases. Spreading awareness can go a long way in saving our future sisters, mothers, friends and wives.
